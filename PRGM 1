1. Retrieve details of all books in the library â€“ id, title, name of publisher, authors, number of copies 
in each branch, etc. 
 
select b.book_id, b.title, b.publisher_name, ba.author_name, bc.branch_id, bc.no_of_copies 
from book b,book_authors ba, book_copies bc 
where b.book_id = bc.book_id and b.book_id = ba.book_id; 
 
2. Get the particulars of borrowers who have borrowed more than 3 books, but from Jan 2017 to Jun 
2017. 
 
select distinct card_no 
from book_lending b 
where (date_out between '17-01-01' and '17-06-30') 
group by card_no having count(*)>3; 
 
3. Delete a book in BOOK table. Update the contents of other tables to reflect this data 
manipulation operation. 
delete from book where book_id='112'; 
 
4. Partition the BOOK table based on year of publication. Demonstrate its working with a simple 
query. 
create table book1 
(  book_id varchar(5), 
title varchar(20), 
publisher_name varchar(10),
publisher_year int, 
primary key(book_id, publisher_year) 
) 
 
partition by range (publisher_year) 
(partition p1 values less than (2002), 
partition p2 values less than (2010), 
partition p3 values less than (maxvalue)); 
5. create a view of all books and its number of copies that are currently available in the library. 
create view available as 
( 
select book_id, sum(no_of_copies) -(select count(card_no) 
from book_lending 
where b.book_id = book_id) as avail_copies 
from book_copies b 
group by book_id 
);
