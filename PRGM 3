1. List the titles of all movies directed by ‘Hitchcock’. 
select mov_title 
from movies m, director d 
where m.dir_id = d.dir_id and d.dir_name ='Hitchcock'; 
 
 
2. Find the movie names where one or more actors acted in two or more movies. 
select distinct mov_title from movies m, movie_cast mc

3. List all actors who acted in a movie before 2000 and also in a movie after 2015 (use JOIN 
operation).

4. Find the title of movies and number of stars for each movie that has at least one rating and find 
the highest number of stars that movie received. Sort the result by movie title. 
select mov_title, max(rev_stars)
