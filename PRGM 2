1. Count the customers with grades above Bangalore’s average. 
select count(*) as count 
from customer where grade > 
(select avg(grade) 
from customer 
where city ='Bangalore'); 
 
2. Find the name and numbers of all salesman who had more than one customer. 
select s.salesman_id, s.name, count(customer_id) 
from salesman s, customer c 
where s.salesman_id = c.salesman_id 
group by s.salesman_id, s.name 
having count(customer_id)>1; 
 
3. List all the salesman and indicate those who have and don’t have customers in their cities (Use UNION operation.) 
select name,'exists' as same_city 
from salesman s 
where city in 
(select city 
from customer 
where s.salesman_id = salesman_id) 
union 
select name,'not exists' as same_city 
from salesman s where 
city not in 
(select city 
from customer 
where s.salesman_id = salesman_id); 
 
4. Create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of a day. 
create view highest_order as 
select s.salesman_id, s.name,o.purchase_amt,o.ord_date 
from salesman s,orders o
where s.salesman_id = o.salesman_id; 
 
select name,ord_date 
from highest_order h 
where purchase_amt = 
(select max(purchase_amt) 
from highest_order 
where h.ord_date = ord_date); 
 
5. Demonstrate the DELETE operation by removing salesman with id 1000. All his orders must also be deleted. 
delete from salesman where salesman_id =3;
